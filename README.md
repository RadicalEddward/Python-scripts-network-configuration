# Python helper script for lab setups
This Python script helps with the configuration of routers in virtual labs, by creating a plain text configuration file with the necessary commands that you can then copy and paste into the CLI.
It further simplifies the configuration by letting you use slash notation, so you don't need to type out the entire subnet mask (and also don't need to convert it).
